        <div class="description">
            <p>Nestled in Kerala’s Western Ghats, Idukki is a cradle for turmeric cultivation. Known as the "Golden Spice," turmeric from these hills is revered for its vivid color, robust taste, and high curcumin content, earning it a special place in culinary and medicinal traditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
            <p>Idukki’s fertile, loamy soils and cool, misty climate create an ideal home for turmeric. The spice thrives here, soaking up nutrients that enhance its warm, peppery notes and vibrant yellow-orange glow. Farmers, rooted in traditional knowledge, coax out its full potential through careful tending and natural methods.</p>
            <p>The shift to chemical farming once dimmed turmeric’s brilliance, leaching the soil and weakening its essence. Now, Idukki’s growers are reclaiming their heritage. By returning to organic practices, they’re nurturing the land and producing turmeric that’s pure, potent, and bursting with life.</p>

        <div class="sustainability">
            <p>In Idukki’s spice-laden hills, growing turmeric free of chemicals is a rare art. Our partner farmers, a dedicated few, have spent over a decade mastering it. They’ve hunted for hardy turmeric strains, revitalized depleted soils, and rebuilt the biodiversity of their farms—all while balancing decent yields. This return to nature-friendly farming demands patience and a bold shift in thinking, but it yields turmeric that’s as golden in spirit as it is in color.</p>
