                    <p>The high ranges of Idukki are known for top-quality spices, especially pepper. Grown at higher elevations, it offers stronger flavor, richer aroma, and higher oil content, making our indigenous varieties truly exceptional.</p>

           <p>Idukki, nestled in the Western Ghats of Kerala, is a prime region for black pepper cultivation. Known as the "King of Spices," black pepper from Idukki's high ranges is celebrated for its superior quality, robust flavor, and high oil content, making it a favorite among spice enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dis2">
           <p>The unique climate of Idukki, characterized by cool temperatures, rich soils, and high altitude, creates the perfect environment for pepper cultivation. These conditions contribute to the distinct aromatic profile and potency of the pepper grown here. Traditional farming practices, passed down through generations, have been integral in maintaining the exceptional quality of Idukki's black pepper.

            However, the rise of modern agricultural practices, including chemical farming, has posed challenges. While these methods initially boosted yields, they have led to environmental concerns such as soil degradation and reduced biodiversity. In response, a growing number of farmers in Idukki are returning to organic and sustainable farming practices. This shift aims to preserve the natural ecosystem, enhance soil fertility, and produce pepper that is both environmentally friendly and of superior quality.</p>

            <p>Today, in the cardamom hills, finding cardamom that's grown chemical free is a task that few accomplish. And farmers who practice nature-friendly farming have become a rarity, a rarity that our partner farmers are part of.  Our farmers took over a decade to find a way back to growing cardamom naturally. It took them several years to find the right varieties, to select stronger plants in their existing cultivation, to rejuvenate their soil and bring back plant health and the thriving bio-diversity in their farms along with maintaining decent yields. Transitioning back to nature-friendly farming although sustainable in the long term is a challenge that many do not prefer as it requires patience, years of search for adaptable varieties and suffer loss of  yield for many years while the soil rejuvenates and more than anything, a shift in the mindset.</p>
