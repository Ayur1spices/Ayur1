Over decades, FLAVEWELL became a symbol of traditional excellence, maintaining integrity while evolving into a household name. The legacy passed down generations is one of hard work, vision, and commitment to authentic flavors.</p></div><div class="card-img-container"><img src="asset/image/history.jpg" alt="History of FLAVEWELL"></div></div>
