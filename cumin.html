        <div class="description">
            <p>Tucked in Kerala’s Western Ghats, Idukki is a prime region for cumin cultivation. Known for its earthy, slightly spicy scent and nutty taste, Idukki cumin is cherished by cooks and spice lovers worldwide for its robust character and versatility.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
            <p>Idukki’s fertile soils and cool, misty climate provide the perfect environment for cumin. The spice thrives here, developing its signature warm aroma and rich flavor through the region’s nutrient-rich land. Farmers, guided by centuries of tradition, cultivate cumin with care, using natural methods to preserve its essence.</p>
            <p>Modern chemical farming once threatened cumin’s quality, depleting soils and dulling its flavor. But today, Idukki’s growers are returning to organic practices. By nurturing the land sustainably, they’re producing cumin that’s pure, potent, and deeply aromatic.</p>

        <div class="sustainability">
            <p>In Idukki’s spice-rich hills, growing cumin without chemicals is a rare skill. Our partner farmers, a committed few, have dedicated years to mastering it. They’ve searched for resilient cumin varieties, restored depleted soils, and revitalized their farms’ ecosystems—all while maintaining steady yields. This shift to nature-friendly farming requires patience and vision, but it yields cumin that’s as rich in spirit as it is in flavor.</p>
